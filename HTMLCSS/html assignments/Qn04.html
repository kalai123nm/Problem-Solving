            Hi, I'm <strong>Kalaiselvan</strong>, but most of my friends call me <strong>Kalai</strong> or <strong>Kutty</strong>.  
            I'm an enthusiastic <strong>Software Developer</strong> and a <strong>Java Full Stack Developer Intern</strong> with a 
            <em>B.Tech in Engineering</em> from <em>M.A.M. College of Engineering, Siruganur, Trichy.</em>.  <br>
        </p><br>
        <p style="border: 2px solid; border-radius: 5px; padding: 25px; letter-spacing: 1px;">
            My technical toolkit includes <strong>HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, MySQL</strong>, and I'm actively 
            exploring <strong>React.js</strong> to strengthen my frontend development skills.  
            I've also worked on projects like a a <em>Library Management System</em>, 
            which helped me understand the real-world application of programming concepts.  
        </p><br>
        <p style="border: 2px solid; border-radius: 5px; padding: 25px; letter-spacing: 1px;">
            Currently, I'm interning at <strong>Zoho</strong> as a Software Developer Intern, where I am sharpening my 
            problem-solving abilities and learning how to build scalable, user-focused applications.  
        </p><br>
        <p style="border: 2px solid; border-radius: 5px; padding: 25px; letter-spacing: 1px;">
            Outside the world of code, I love <strong>playing chess</strong>, which helps me think strategically, 
            and <strong>writing Tamil poetry</strong>, which fuels my creativity. I believe both of these hobbies 
            complement my programming journey by balancing logic with imagination.  
        </p><br>
        <p style="border: 2px solid; border-radius: 5px; padding: 25px; letter-spacing: 1px;">
            My career goal is to become a <strong>full-time software developer</strong> who not only builds efficient solutions 
            but also contributes to impactful projects that make life easier for people. With every step, I aim to 
            improve, learn, and inspire others.
